			<h2> About us, The Popstar Shop </h2>
			<p> <strong> P</strong>opstar shop is guided by four things: customer's obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for the kirby franchise, love for nintendo in general and being as available as we can be. We strive to do our best and meet our customer's needs and are even open to custom made items so long as they are within our power and jurisdictions. </p>

			<h2> How we came to be </h2>
			<p> From the Founder of this website, with his obsession with the first Kirby game in 1992, having been born only 2 years after he grew up withthe kirby games and fell in love with them. As Technology advanced and more kirby games came to be, he began to learn how to create these plushies and even recruited fellow friends to help with this Project, dubbing our first debut at our School's charity drive in 2007. The project debuted in the charity as "Kamadi's Dreamland: Planet Popstar" in which it garnered the most money for the school to donate to the orphanage being donated to. Taking this idea onwards from his love for computers as well, he began studying computer science to advance the idea of selling it better and connecting with others using MySpace before eventually going on a hiatus for years before coming back years later with his own site akin to Amazon to sell. With his smarts and influence from the charity drive he was able to get the rights and was legally allowed to sell these plushies from Nintendo. Marking the official debut of Popstar Shop in 2010. </p>
